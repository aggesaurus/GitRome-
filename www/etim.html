        <p>
            According to the founding myth of the city by the Ancient Romans themselves, the long-held tradition of the origin of the name Roma is believed to have come from the city's founder and first king, Romulus.
        </p>
        <p> However, it is a possibility that the name Romulus was actually derived from Rome itself. 
            As early as the 4th century, there have been alternative theories proposed on the origin of the name Roma. 
            Several hypotheses have been advanced focusing on its linguistic roots which however remain uncertain:
        
        </p>
        <p>
                <ol>
                        <li>from Rumon or Rumen, archaic name of the Tiber, which in turn has the same root as the Greek verb ῥέω (rhéō) and the Latin verb ruo, which both mean "flow";[b] </li>
                        <li>from the Etruscan word 𐌓𐌖𐌌𐌀 (ruma), whose root is *rum- "teat", with possible reference either to the totem wolf that adopted and suckled the cognately named twins Romulus and Remus, or to the shape of the Palatine and Aventine Hills;</li>  
                        <li> from the Greek word ῥώμη (rhṓmē), which means strength.</li>
                     </ol>
